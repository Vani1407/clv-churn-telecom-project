# 📞 Telecom Customer Lifetime Value & Churn Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
Telecom companies often struggle with **customer retention** due to high churn rates.  
This project focuses on:
- **Predicting customer churn** (whether a customer will leave).
- **Estimating Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** to identify profitable customers.  

The analysis uses customer demographics, usage patterns, and service information to build predictive models.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze customer data to understand factors influencing churn.
- Build machine learning models to predict **customer churn**.
- Estimate **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**.
- Provide business insights for **customer retention strategies**.

## 💡 Business Insights

Customers on monthly contracts are more likely to churn.
High monthly charges contribute to customer dissatisfaction.
Retention campaigns should focus on long-term contracts and discount plans.
CLV helps identify high-value customers worth retaining.
